# Fictional Characters Catalogue
A web application which catalogues fictional characters from all sorts of movies, books, games, and others.

## How to run
The easiest way to run the application is via the ``docker-compose.dev.yml`` file. Everything, including environments, has been configured so that the app can be run right out of the box.

Although the dockerized backend supports hot reload, you may experience slowness in compilation. In that case, it's better to run it locally when writing code for it and only run the services that you need (like the database).
